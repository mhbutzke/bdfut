# Nested includes

The nested include allows you to further enrich your data by requesting more information from a standard include. Might sound difficult, but we assure you, it’s anything but hard. This is how we use nested includes.

### Create your request&#x20;

For example, in our [includes tutorial ](../../../tutorials-and-guides/tutorials/includes)you’ve enriched your [GET Fixture by Date](../../../endpoints-and-entities/endpoints/fixtures/get-fixtures-by-date) request with the `participant`, and `events` includes:

```javascript
https://api.sportmonks.com/v3/football/fixtures/date/2022-09-03?api_token=YOUR_TOKEN&include=participants;events
```

The include event shows you the data about players who received a card, scored a goal, or were substituted. A snippet of the response:&#x20;

     //And more

But what if we want to know more about the players, who scored a goal, like their country of origin, height, weight, age, image, etc? This is where the nested include comes into play!

### Using nested includes&#x20;

The nested includes are represented in the form of dots (.), which are then linked to a standard include. This shows their relationship.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Check our [syntax section](../../syntax) for a complete syntax overview.
{% endhint %}

Because the include event is related to a player. You can add `.player` to the include, which will result in the nested include: `events.player`

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```javascript
https://api.sportmonks.com/v3/football/fixtures/date/2022-09-03?api_token=YOUR_TOKEN&include=participants;events.player
```
{% endcode %}
