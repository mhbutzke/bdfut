{% tab title="Static Filters" %}
**Static filters** are always the same and filter in one specific way without any custom options. Each static filter is listed below and has a description of how it filters. For more information, please look at our[ Filters page](../../../api/request-options/filtering).

<table><thead><tr><th width="165">Static Filters</th><th width="114">Available on Entity</th><th width="197">Description</th><th width="274">Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>ParticipantSearch</code></td><td>Fixture</td><td>Filter on the matches of specific participants.</td><td><code>&include=participants&filters=participantSearch:Celtic</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>todayDate</code></td><td>Fixture</td><td>Filter all fixtures to find only the fixtures of today.</td><td><code>&filters=todayDate</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>venues</code></td><td>Fixture</td><td>Find all fixtures that are played in a specific venue.</td><td><code>&include=venue&filters=venues:venueIDs</code><br><br><code>&include=venue&filters=venues:10,12</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>IsDeleted</code></td><td>Fixture</td><td>Filter on deleted fixtures only.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Dynamic Filters" %}
The **dynamic filters** are based on entities and includes. Each dynamic filter uses an entity to filter on and one entity to apply the filter on. Below are examples with explanations of how filters are set up. For more information, please look at our [Filters page.](../../../api/request-options/filtering)

{% hint style="info" %}
Using an include? Check their respective filters on their entity page. For example if you use `&include=participants` you can apply [team-related filters](../../../entities/team-player-squad-coach-and-referee#team).&#x20;
{% endhint %}
