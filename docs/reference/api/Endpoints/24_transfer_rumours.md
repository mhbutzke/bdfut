# Transfer rumours | API 3.0

Do you want the latest inside scoop before it hits the headlines? The **Transfer Rumours** endpoint delivers data on potential player moves, straight from the rumour mill. Whether it's speculation or serious chatter, you'll get all the details needed to inform your app visitors.

Each rumour entry provides:

*   🔄 **Player** involved in the rumour
    
*   📍 **Destination team(s)** the player might join
    
*   📈 **Probability** of the transfer happening
    
*   📰 **Source** of the rumour
    
*   💰 **Monetary value** tied to the deal (if known)
    

> 💡 A single player can appear in multiple rumours, potentially linked to different destination teams (e.g., both Team A and Team B).

⚠️ These are _rumours_, not confirmed transfers. 📌 This data is **not linked** to standard models like fixtures or events. 🔗 Use the **dedicated transfer-rumours endpoints** to retrieve this data.
