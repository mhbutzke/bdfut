# Data corrections

## How do we handle data corrections?

Our in-house data collection platform manages all of our data. Our dedicated scout teams from all over the world add, manage and validate the data collected by this platform.&#x20;

We collaborate with high-class data partners to ensure our football data is reliable and always up to date. However, since data is also human work, errors or inconsistencies may occur. To ensure the highest quality of football data, we have a mandatory process for promptly and effectively handling data corrections.&#x20;

### Data verification and validation

Before making any updates or corrections, we employ a rigorous verification and validation process. Our dedicated team of data experts reviews and cross-checks the information from our data scouts and professional data partners.

Once a data correction is reported or identified, our data correction team immediately investigates the issue and takes the necessary steps to fix it. We have a system in place to identify the priority of the data error and fix it accordingly.&#x20;

### Continuous improvement

We are committed to continuous improvement and strive to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our data. To identify areas for improvement, we regularly review our internal processes, systems, and feedback mechanisms. By leveraging user feedback and utilising the latest technologies, we aim to provide the most comprehensive and error-free data in the sports field.

_**Weâ€™re dedicated to maintaining the highest data quality and reliability standards.**_
