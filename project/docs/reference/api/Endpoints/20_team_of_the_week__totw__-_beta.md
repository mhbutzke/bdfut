# Team of the Week (TOTW) - beta

Our Teamâ€¯ofâ€¯theâ€¯Week (TOTW) engine automatically picks the top 11 performers of every round using Sportmonksâ€™ proprietary Player Rating model. No editorial biasâ€”just dataâ€‘driven, repeatable selection.

How do we calculate the TOTW?

Our TOTW logic has been carefully designed to reflect each playerâ€™s impact and position on the pitch:

1.  **Lineup roles** We begin by collecting player ratings from every lineup and determine each player\'s specific role based on their actual formationâ€”for example, distinguishing between a centre-back and a left-back.
    
2.  **Formation matching** For several commonly used formations, we then select the highest-rated player for each role, while ensuring no more than 3 players from the same team are chosen. This keeps the lineup competitive and diverse.
    
3.  **Best formation** We calculate the average rating of each possible TOTW lineup, and the formation with the highest score becomes our Team of the Week for that round.
