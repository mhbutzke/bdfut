This is currently a beta feature. Please contact our support team if you're interested in joining the beta

**Match Facts** is a premium data feature that provides structured, ready-to-use match insights. Helping you surface deep context before and during games without needing to build your own logic.

It’s designed to power fantasy games, betting apps, livescore platforms, and match previews with smart, real-time and historical data.

#### 

What’s Included?

Match Facts are compiled using a range of historical and live data points, including:

🔁 **Head-to-head statistics**

*   Total matches played between two teams
    
*   Wins, losses, and draws
    

🎯 **Scoring trends**

*   Frequency of matches ending with over 0.5, 1.5, 2.5+ goals
    
*   Goal distribution insights
    

⚡ **First-to-score patterns**

*   Win/draw/loss breakdown based on which team scores first
    

🟨 **Live match context**

*   Outcomes based on the current scoreline
    
*   Real-time facts triggered by in-match events like yellow/red cards
    

📈 **And more**

*   Momentum-based data
    
*   Situational facts relevant to team performance
    

You can also use the `matchFacts` include on one of our fixtures endpoint.

When you opt for the `matchFacts` include on one of the fixtures endpoint, you can also use the `havingLiveMatchFacts` filter. This filters fixtures that have live match facts, such as outcomes by players sent off field & outcomes by goals
